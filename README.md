# Spam-Website Opener

As the repository name implies, this is a tool to mess with your pals since it opens webpages with spam.

## Usage

Open the Python file in console mode on your friend's computer or laptop and watch how they react to the chaos (it's quite amusing, I promise).

## Note

-   The program is designed to open a link randomly every 5 seconds (adjustable time). 
-   I've incorporated several websites relevant to developer applications into the code (additional links can be added or removed by editing the source Python file).

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3
-   Webbrowser Module (built-in module)
-   Time Module (built-in module)
-   Random Module (built-in module)
